Computer Science is the study of computation, automation, and information. It encompasses a wide range of topics—from the theoretical foundations of algorithms and data structures to the practical challenges of designing and building software systems.

> **Why Computer Science Matters:** Today’s world is driven by software: from smartphones and web apps to AI and scientific simulations. Understanding computer science equips you with the tools to innovate and solve real-world problems.

## A Brief History

The journey of Computer Science began in the early 19th century with **Ada Lovelace** and **Charles Babbage**. Over the decades, it evolved through:

- **1930s-1940s:** Turing’s theoretical machines and the first electronic computers
- **1950s-1960s:** Emergence of high-level programming languages (Fortran, COBOL)
- **1970s-1980s:** Personal computing revolution, Unix, and C language
- **1990s:** Rise of the Internet, web technologies (HTML, JavaScript)
- **2000s-Present:** Mobile computing, cloud, big data, and AI

## Key Subfields

### Algorithms & Data Structures

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems, and data structures organize information efficiently.

```javascript
// Example: Simple binary search in JavaScript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
    else right = mid - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

### Systems & Architecture

Study of computer hardware, operating systems, and networking.

### Software Engineering

Principles and practices for designing, developing, and maintaining software.

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Algorithms and systems that learn from data and make decisions.

### Cybersecurity

Protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
